# Air Monitor Control
Many lives had been lost since several people are not aware that they have recieved low quality air. An sir quality monitor has an expensive cost on the market. To avoid paying a high price, people can make a cheap, portable, air quality monitor.

Hello, my name is Ayan. I have updated my project. In this video, I will be explaining my second milestone. For my project, the Air Quality Monitor, I previously used an OLED to display the readings of temperature, humidity, and air quality. However, since the OLED size was limited, it wasnâ€™t able to  I switched the OLED with an LCD. The LCD was able to display the data from the sensors in better quality. The LCD is connected by multiple wires of digital pins. The LCD is further connected by a potentiometer. Three wires are connected to the potentiometer to power it. When the potentiometer turns, the brightness of the LCD monitor changes. The MQ135 and DHT11 sensors are now connected to the LCD. The LCD display three sets of data. Temperature, humidity, and concentration. The code used ppm which changes the data on the display the results detected by the MQ135 and DHT11. Thank you for listening to my Milestone 2 video. 



For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

  Before I started building the Air Quality Monitor, I primarily needed to learn programming for Arduino IDE. When I was buikding the circuit, I had difficulty placing the connection with the Arduino board and the OLED display. Since I have never used an OLED before, I searched for other strategies by experimenting with the circuit. After I installed the MQ135 senor, I realized that I require a 5v port for both items. However, I only had one port on the Arduino board. I learned that the edges of the Arduino board that had a + and - symbol can be used to transfer power all the ports on the edges. I used the breadboard port edges to power the OLED display and the MQ135 sensor to be powered by 5v. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
